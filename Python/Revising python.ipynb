    "A parity bit is a simple mechanism for detecting errors in data transmitted over an\n",
    "unreliable connection such as a telephone line. The basic idea is that an additional bit\n",
    "is transmitted after each group of 8 bits so that a single bit error in the transmission\n",
    "can be detected.\n",
    "Parity bits can be computed for either even parity or odd parity. If even parity\n",
    "is selected then the parity bit that is transmitted is chosen so that the total number\n",
    "of one bits transmitted (8 bits of data plus the parity bit) is even. When odd parity\n",
    "is selected the parity bit is chosen so that the total number of one bits transmitted\n",
    "is odd.\n",
    "Write a program that computes the parity bit for groups of 8 bits entered by the\n",
    "user using even parity. Your program should read strings containing 8 bits until the\n",
    "user enters a blank line. After each string is entered by the user your program should\n",
    "display a clear message indicating whether the parity bit should be 0 or 1. Display\n",
    "an appropriate error message if the user enters something other than 8 bits.\n",
    "Hint: You should read the input from the user as a string. Then you can use\n",
    "the count method to help you determine the number of zeros and ones in the\n",
