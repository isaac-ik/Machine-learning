            <p>In every field, there are questions that are always trying to be answered and these questions drive how they use analytical tools.
            <p><b>Question Formulation</b>: The first step in any data analysis process is to clearly define the questions you want to answer. These questions could relate to understanding customer behavior, optimizing business processes, or predicting future trends.</p>
            <p><b>Tool Selection</b>: Once you have your questions, you can then select the analytical tools and techniques that are best suited to answer them. For example, if you're trying to understand patterns in customer data, you might use clustering or segmentation techniques. If you're trying to predict future sales, you might use regression analysis or time series forecasting.</p>
            <p><b>Data Collection and Preparation</b>: With your questions and tools in mind, you can then collect and prepare your data. This might involve cleaning the data, transforming it into a usable format, and selecting the relevant variables for analysis.</p>
            <p><b>Analysis</b>: Once your data is ready, you can apply your chosen analytical techniques to uncover insights and patterns. This could involve running statistical tests, building predictive models, or visualizing the data in meaningful ways.</p>
            <p><b>Insight Generation</b>: The ultimate goal of data analytics is to generate actionable insights from the data. By answering your initial questions, you can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying trends and relationships in your data, which can then be used to inform decision-making.</p>
